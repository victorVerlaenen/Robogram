# Robogram
2D puzzle game, made in Unity.
## General
There are a few different abilities that the player can activate. The player can only have 2 abilities active at 1 time. So the main challenge is looking at the level, and thinking about which programs are the ones needed to complete the level. 
### Acces points
The player can only activate programs when near an acces point. So if the player makes the wrong decisions, he needs to restart the level. Thinking ahead is key.
## Programs (abilities)
There are currently only 4 programs.
### Extending program
This program makes it possible to shoot out a hand of the player until it hits a wall or interactable (button etc). This helps with making the player able to press buttons that he can not reach etc.
### Hardening program
Hardening program makes the player able to traverse lasers. 
### Interacting program
Interacting program makes the player able to press buttons.
### Pushing program
This program makes the player able to push big obstacles to the side.
### Combining of programs
All the programs work togheter in some sort of way. Extending program, and hardening program together make it possible to shoot the hand trough lasers. Interacting and extending make it possible to press buttons at theh other side of the level, etc.
## Other elements
There are also lasers, elevators, buttons etc that work together with the programs to build a level.
